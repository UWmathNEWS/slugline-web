## slugline-web
The front-end component of `slugline`, mathNEWS's best and only React/Django based publishing website.

## Running
It's a standard create-react-app project, `npm run start` to run. Grab a copy of the server [here](github.com/UWmathNEWS/slugline-api). By default, the server runs at port 8000, and the `proxy` setting in `package.json` is designed to redirect requests from the dev server to there. If you change the server port, change the port in `package.json` as well.
